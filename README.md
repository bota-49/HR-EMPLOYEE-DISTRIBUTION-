HR EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION # HR Employee Distribution Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the distribution of employees across departments, job roles, genders, and experience levels using SQL and Power BI.

## Objective
To explore how employees are distributed within the organization and to identify patterns related to workforce allocation, diversity, and structure.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Used for data cleaning, filtering, and generating aggregated datasets
- **Power BI**: Used for building interactive visualizations and dashboards

## Project Workflow
1. Raw HR data was imported and cleaned using SQL queries.
2. Structured queries were written to summarize key distributions (e.g., employees per department, gender ratios, job levels).
3. The results were connected to Power BI for dashboard creation and dynamic exploration.

## Key Insights
- Distribution of employees by department and job level
- Gender representation across various units
- Average experience per department
- Visual mapping of headcount trends

## Files Included
- `Employee_Distribution_Queries.sql`: SQL scripts used for data preparation
- `HR_Distribution_Report.pbix`: Power BI dashboard
- `dashboard.png`: Preview of the final report
- `README.md`: Documentation and summary

## Notes
This project highlights the power of combining SQL for backend processing with Power BI for front-end storytelling in HR analytics.
